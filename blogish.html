                    Hey everyone, it's officially spring in Norway ☀️🌿🇳🇴, I just got my sunscreen 🧴, I'm ready for summer and here's my new blogish! 
                    When I think of blogs I imagine all these fancy cookies with glaze on them 🧁, 
                    pink lipsticks 💄 and <i>outfit of the day</i> 👘, that's why I couldn't help calling this a blogish. Don't get me wrong, 
                    I'm a girl, I like lipstick, but most likely there will be no
                    cookies to find here, and especially not an outfit of the day - but who knows, sometimes I surprise myself. 
                    Anyways you might risk bumping into some plants here, though! 🌱
                    I love my plants, they're my babies. I have new ones born every once in a while, as I plant the babies of everything I eat. 
                    I'm just too curious about what the mother looked like as a baby to keep myself from letting them outgrow my house. 🏡
                    <br/><br/>
                    Anyplants 🌴 (I'm about to grow a palm tree..), I just want to share the things I'm excited about. So here goes. I usually put all my stuff on 
                    <a href="https://github.com/jennur">GitHub</a>, but that's just not as satisfying, so that's why I'm here 🤠. I feel pretty
                    confident that this will end up being about tech and plants, so I guess I might as well just call it Plants and Codies.
                    <br><br/>
                    That's it for now, I'll try to get this thing up and running! But first I want to redo my site, so plz gimme just a tiny piece of patience.
