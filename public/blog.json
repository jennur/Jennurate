        "Don 't get me wrong, I 'm a girl, I like lipstick, but most likely there will be no cookies to find here, and especially not an outfit of the day - but who knows, sometimes I surprise myself.",
        "You might risk bumping into some plants here, though!🌱",
        "I love my plants, they 're my babies.",
        "I have new ones born every once in a while, as I plant the babies of everything I eat.",
        "I 'm just too curious about what the mother looked like as a baby to keep myself from letting them outgrow my house. 🏡",
        "Anyplants🌴(I 'm about to grow a palm tree..), I just want to share the things I'm excited about.",
        "So here goes.",
        "I usually put all my stuff on GitHub, but that 's just not as satisfying, so that's why I 'm here 🤠.",
        "I feel pretty confident that this will end up being about tech and plants, so I guess I might as well just call it Plants and Codies.",
        "That 's it for now, I'll try to get this thing up and running!But first I want to redo my site, so plz gimme just a tiny piece of patience."
