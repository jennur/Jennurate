        "In a crazy moment where my brain stopped and the love for my plants just exploded and I thought *WATER IS NOT ENOUGH, WATER IS NOT ENOUGH* 🧠🚨💓💥, I gave them what I didn't quite realize was CONCENTRATED fertilizer. ☠️ ",
        "Previously I've been really careful with this stuff and added maybe something like 2 table spoons in 1.5 liters of water (in case it was concentrated - well I know now)... but not this time. ",
        "Can you imagine what happened? Yes, of course they all died! I ended up mourning for a few days before I planted new ones and they started to sprout. ",
        "What's really cool tho, is that after I desperately tried to leach the soil of the tomatoes, by advice from the Google, my tomatoes died, but after a few days some new ones showed up! 🌱 ",
        "Maybe they just needed a fertilizer boost to sprout! They grow fast too. "
